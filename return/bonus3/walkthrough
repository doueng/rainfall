#> strings bonus3
execl
/bin/sh
 [...]
fopen
fread
/home/user/end/.pass

Going throught it in gdb:
 - reads ///.pass in buffer
 - sets buffer[atoi(argv[1])] to 0
 - reads ///.pass in buffer + 66
 - closes fd
 - if !strcmp(argv[1], buffer)
  \-> execl("/bin/sh");
 - else puts(buffer + 66)

If the file can't be read or if argc != 2
the binary exits.

To make the strcmp condition succeed we can send an empty
string as input:
#> ./bonus3 ""

atoi evaluates it to 0
strcmp stops directly after reading the first char
and 0 == 0
